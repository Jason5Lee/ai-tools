# AI Tools

Tools powered by AI (such as large language models).

Currently under active development. Check out the `dev` branch for the latest progress.

## Ideas

- Decouple implementation from specific models to enable easy extension and support for other models.
- Provide a Manual Mode that allows users to manually execute prompts to obtain results, supporting usage scenarios such as web-based AI platforms.
